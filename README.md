# Movie Database Application

This is a small movie database application built with ASP.NET MVC in C#. Based on the Microsoft tutorial (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/movie-database/create-a-movie-database-application-in-15-minutes-with-asp-net-mvc-cs), this application allows movies to be added to the database with title, director and release date attributes.
